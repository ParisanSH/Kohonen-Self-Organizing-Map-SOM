# Kohonen-Self-Organizing-Map-SOM-
In this mini project, I have tried to train and test a SOM network to do cluster analysis of news collection, from the BBC news website corresponding to stories in five topical areas from 2004-2005. The dataset is a collection of 2225 news documents, categorized into 5 classes ‘business’, ‘entertainment’, ‘politics’, ‘sport’, and ‘tech’.
